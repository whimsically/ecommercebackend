# <Ecommerce-Backend>

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js and Sequelize. First, with Sequelize, I created models for the data with appropriate associations. Next, I added CRUD routes for each type (Products, Categories, and Tags).

## Installation

- Clone the GitHub repo
- Install dependencies
- 'source schema.sql' in mysql shell
